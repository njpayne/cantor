/* Write a program that calculates the average monthly rainfall for three months. The program should ask the user to
enter the name of each month, such as June or July, and the amount of rain (in inches), that fell that month. The program
should display a message similar to the following: "The average monthly rainfall for June, July, and August was 6.72 inches." */

# The speed of sound varies depending on the medium through which it travels.
# In general, sound travels fastest in rigid media, such as steel, slower in liquid media, such as water,
# and slowest of all in gases, such as air. The following table shows the approximate speed of sound,
# measured in feet per second, in air, water, and steel (Speed is feet per sec): Air, 1100; Water 4900; Steel 16400
# Write a program that allows a user to select air, water or steel. After the user has made a selection
# the number of feet a sound wave will travel in the selected medium should be entered.
# The program should then display the amount of time it will take. Round the answer to 4 decimal places.

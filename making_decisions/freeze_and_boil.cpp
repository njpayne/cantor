#The following table lists the freezing and boiling points of several substances. Write a program that asks the
# user to enter a temperateur, and then shows all the substances that will freeze at that temperature and all
# that will boil at that temperature. For example, if the user enters -20, the program should report that water will
# freeze at that temperature and oxygen will boil at that temperature.
# Ethyl alcohol: -173 Freezing; 172 boiling; Mercury: -38 freezing; 676 boiling; Oxygen: -362 freezing; -306 boiling
# Water: 32 Freezing; 212 boiling
